### Datasets Used:

1. **COYO-700M**  
   The COYO-700M dataset is a large-scale collection of text-image pairs, providing a diverse and extensive resource for our embedding tasks.

3. **Subset of COYO-700M (1,000 {text:image} pairs)**  
   We created a focused subset of 1,000 `{text: image}` pairs from the COYO-700M dataset, tailored to meet the specific needs of our project.

### Purpose & Usage

- **Purpose:**  
  The primary aim of using the COYO-700M dataset was to leverage its extensive text-image pairs for generating embeddings that could later be analyzed for contextual understanding. This dataset provided a solid foundation for creating meaningful embeddings and assessing their quality.

- **Usage in the Project:**  
  - **COYO-700M:** Served as the base dataset for understanding how large-scale text and image data can be converted into embeddings.
  - **Subset of 1,000 pairs:** Used for more detailed analysis, allowing us to focus on a manageable set of data for embedding creation, visualization, and contextual evaluation.
