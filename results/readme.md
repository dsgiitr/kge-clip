# Results Overview

This folder contains the results generated from the various experiments and analyses conducted throughout the project. The results are derived from applying different embedding techniques, dimensionality reduction methods, and knowledge graph generation processes. Each subfolder and file within this directory corresponds to a specific set of experiments or visualizations.

## Sources of Results

1. **Text-Image Vector Embeddings**:
   - Results in this section are obtained from the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the CLIP model. These embeddings represent the encoded visual and semantic features of the text-image pairs used in the experiments.

2. **Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)**:
   - This section includes results from the generation of knowledge graphs. The graphs were built by extracting entities and relations from text data using tools like REBEL and NetworkX, then embedding these relationships into vector space for analysis.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
   - The results here showcase the visualization of high-dimensional embeddings reduced to 2D or 3D space using methods such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and clustering of embeddings.

## Types of Results

- **Embedding Visualizations**: Plots and graphs illustrating the distribution of text-image vector embeddings and knowledge graph embeddings in reduced dimensional space.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Graphical representations of the entities and their interrelationships extracted from text data.
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative evaluations of the embedding techniques, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Additional Notes

- Each result file is named according to the experiment or method used, making it easier to track the source and relevance of the data.
- The results are intended to support the conclusions drawn in the corresponding project documentation and serve as a visual and analytical validation of the methodologies applied.
