# Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of documents, blogs, and research papers that delve into various aspects of Text-Image Vector Embeddings and Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs). The aim is to explore and compare different embedding methods, with a focus on their application in computer vision, natural language processing, and knowledge representation.

## Document 1: Embedding Methods Comparison and Visualization

### Overview
This document presents an in-depth exploration of different embedding methods, primarily focusing on Text-Image Vector Embeddings and KGEs. It provides a comparative analysis of multimodal model architectures, such as CLIP, and demonstrates their use in visual and semantic encoding, as well as in knowledge graph construction.

### Project Structure
The content is divided into two main sections:
1. **Text-Image Vector Embeddings**:
   - Fundamentals of word and image embeddings.
   - Utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the CLIP model for encoding visual and semantic data.
   
2. **Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)**:
   - Techniques for creating and visualizing knowledge graphs from textual data.
   - Application of tools like NetworkX and transformers such as REBEL for relation extraction.

### Key Concepts
- **Text and Image Embeddings**: Techniques for encoding high-level visual and semantic features using models like CLIP.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Methodologies for extracting entities and relationships from text to construct semantic networks.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Visualization strategies using PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.

### Getting Started
